## REVIVAR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERNSHIP ASSETSMENT
For this assessment you’ll be creating a website where a user selects from 4 random images to
create a “thank you” card. To do this use a random image generator API to get the 4 images the
users should pick from. Once they pick and enter their name the website should overlay the
selected image with the user’s name and a “thank you” text.
Their name should be imprinted on the bottom of the image and thank you should be on the
top. This newly generated image should be downloadable. The dimension(ratio) of this image
should be 4:5.
Here is an example of the generated image
```API: https://source.unsplash.com/random/300x300```
